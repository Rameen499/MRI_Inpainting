This work extends denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for inpainting healthy 3D brain tissue in MRI scans, addressing pathological regions. Various DDPM modifications (2D, pseudo-3D, 3D, and latent models) were evaluated, with the pseudo-3D model performing the best based on structural similarity, signal-to-noise ratio, and error metrics
